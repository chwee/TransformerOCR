# TransformerOCR
##Part 1
  - To develop a object detection model to identify the handwriting line of word
  - Extract each line using the coordinate predicated
  - Use the Detectron2 as the basic model to develop the object detection model

##Part 2
  - Use the part 1 extracted line of word to train a handwriting OCR
  - The handwriting OCR must be able to predict the handwriting line of word
  - Use Use the Huggingface Transformer OCR to develop the OCR prediction model
